# UEA-5GNetwork-Support

This repository is built to give a guide for how to install kubernetes using Minikube
details will be added to explain what you can change to support your chosen configuration

We will also include a script created to manipulate VM's.

This is included as it was a part of our research project and it could be useful for other configurations
