Open5gs-k8s - first, if this is not working, I will try free5gc, although this needs 20.04

https://github.com/tliron/open5gs-k8s

these other projects also exist so it might be worth checking them also:
https://www.datree.io/helm-chart/open5gs-cgiraldo#install
https://bitbucket.org/infinitydon/opensource-5g-core-service-mesh/src/main/

free5gc:
https://github.com/Orange-OpenSource/towards5gs-helm



command list:

(download kubectl but do not install yet)

sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install -y apt-transport-https ca-certificates curl
sudo mkdir -p -m 755 /etc/apt/keyrings
curl -fsSL https://pkgs.k8s.io/core:/stable:/v1.30/deb/Release.key | sudo gpg --dearmor -o /etc/apt/keyrings/kubernetes-apt-keyring.gpg
sudo chmod 644 /etc/apt/keyrings/kubernetes-apt-keyring.gpg # allow unprivileged APT programs to read this keyring
echo 'deb [signed-by=/etc/apt/keyrings/kubernetes-apt-keyring.gpg] https://pkgs.k8s.io/core:/stable:/v1.30/deb/ /' | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/kubernetes.list
sudo chmod 644 /etc/apt/sources.list.d/kubernetes.list  


(install docker as this is a dependency for Kubernetes)

sudo apt-get update
sudo apt install docker.io
sudo systemctl start docker
sudo systemctl enable docker
sudo apt update

(now install kubectl now the dependency is satisfied, for simplicity you can swap the order but this is what I had done)

sudo apt-get install -y kubectl

(I now installed Minikube as it is much easier to use for running Kubernetes locally in my opinion)

curl -LO https://storage.googleapis.com/minikube/releases/latest/minikube_latest_amd64.deb
sudo dpkg -i minikube_latest_amd64.deb


(docker by default only works in a root, so these commands allow you to use them as any user)

sudo groupadd docker # may result in saying group already exists, continue anyway
sudo usermod -aG docker $USER
newgrp docker
docker run hello-world

results in something similar to below:



Hello from Docker!
This message shows that your installation appears to be working correctly.

To generate this message, Docker took the following steps:
 1. The Docker client contacted the Docker daemon.
 2. The Docker daemon pulled the "hello-world" image from the Docker Hub.
    (amd64)
 3. The Docker daemon created a new container from that image which runs the
    executable that produces the output you are currently reading.
 4. The Docker daemon streamed that output to the Docker client, which sent it
    to your terminal.

(now install additional dependencies for free5gc as towards5gs-helm is built off of it)

sudo apt install -y curl wget apt-transport-https
sudo apt install gcc
sudo apt install make
git clone -b v0.8.1 https://github.com/free5gc/gtp5g.git
cd gtp5g
